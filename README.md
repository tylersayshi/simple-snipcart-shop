## Features

- Easy sections for selling and displaying reviews
- PostCSS for autoprefixing
- SCSS for easy styling
- [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com)

## Install theme on your hugo site

```
hugo new site your-site-name # if you already have a site ignore this line and the next
cd your-site-name
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/tylersayshi/simple-snipcart-shop.git
```

Once you have done this, you may use the `exampleSite` folder as an example for how to set your project up. The two main things to pay attention to is to first set this in your `hugo.toml` file:

```toml
theme = "simple-snipcart-shop"
```

Then you will need to replicate the data used in the `exampleSite/data/reviews/` if you want to show reviews. Please also see the `exampleSite/hugo.toml` for guidance on setting up the more general site configurations.
